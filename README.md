# Starter Project Setup Guide

Welcome to the Starter Project! This guide is designed to help you quickly set up a modern development environment using Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Express, and Node.js. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the setup process, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

### Node.js

Node.js is essential for running JavaScript server-side and is the backbone of this project setup. If it's not already installed on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the version appropriate for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

### Browser-Sync

For an enhanced development experience with hot reloading capabilities, especially when working with Tailwind CSS, `browser-sync` is recommended. It allows you to see changes in real-time without manually refreshing your browser. If you haven't installed `browser-sync` globally on your machine, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash 
npm install -g browser-sync
```
